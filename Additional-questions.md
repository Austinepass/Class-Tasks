**(a) Why Kotlin is interoperable with java**

When Kotlin and Java source codes are compiled by their respective compilers, they generate byte code (.class) which will 
run on the the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Since the two .class files are equivalent in nature, they can communicate with
each other, and that is how interaoperability is established. Now, we can use the methods and properties defined in kotlin 
by calling the kotlin class instance in java and vice versa.


**(b) Difference between procedural and object oriented programming**

**Procedural oriented programming (POP)** is programming model based on procedures or functions, which divide computational
programs into smaller units or steps to be carried out. In POP, hiding of data is not properly done,leading to security concerns.
Creating of new data or functions are not easily implemented in this model as well. FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, and C all
utilize pocedural oriented programming.

**Object oriented programming (OOP),** on the other hand, models computer programs with the concept of real life objects with properties
and methods to interact with the objects which are instances of a class. Data encapsulation, abstraction, etc are all possible here thereby
making OOP programs more secure than other programming models. Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, 
Scala are all examples of OOP languages.
